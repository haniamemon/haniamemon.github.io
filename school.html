<h2> University Course Experience</h2>
<p> Throughout my university career, I've found many courses to be very engaging. <br>
I've included a list of courses I've found to be especially useful: </p>
<p>
  <ul>
          <dl>
      <li> ITM 200 - Introduction to Programming</li>
      <dd> This course was particularly interesting! I was able to understand some fundamentals of Python, which has been very valuable for personal projects and job searching.</dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
      <li> CMN 279 - Professional Communication</li>
      <dd> Through this course, I was able to learn how to communicate effectively within a professional setting.<br>
          Sometimes I struggle to write professional emails but even after 2 years I continue to apply what I learned in CMN 279!
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <dl>
      <li>ITM 500 - Data and Information Management</li>
      <dd> Through this course, I was able to learn basic SQL and querying, which is something I've been interested in learning for a long time! <br>
      This is also a great practical skill that I could add to my resume!</dd>
  </ul>
          </dl>
