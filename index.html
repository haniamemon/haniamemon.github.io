<h2> University Course Experience</h2>
<p> Throughout my university career, I've found many courses to be very engaging. <br>
I've included a list of courses I've found to be especially useful: </p>
<p>
    <ul>
            <dl>
        <li> ITM 200 - Introduction to Programming</li>
        <dd> This course was particularly interesting! I was able to understand some fundamentals of Python, which has been very valuable for personal projects and job searching.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
        <li> CMN 279 - Professional Communication</li>
        <dd> Through this course, I was able to learn how to communicate effectively within a professional setting.<br>
            Sometimes I struggle to write professional emails but even after 2 years I continue to apply what I learned in CMN 279!
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
        <li>ITM 500 - Data and Information Management</li>
        <dd> Through this course, I was able to learn basic SQL and querying, which is something I've been interested in learning for a long time! <br>
        This is also a great practical skill that I could add to my resume!</dd>
    </ul>
            </dl>
